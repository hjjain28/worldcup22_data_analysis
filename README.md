# worldcup22_data_analysis

I used cricket T20 World Cup (2022) data to build insights on the best 11-player team.
Collected data from the espncricinfo website for every ball of the World Cup.
Following some data transformation and cleaning in Pandas, I created dashboards in PowerBI.
Used various statistics such as average, strike rate, dot ball, and boundary percentage of players to create the best-playing 11 of the World Cup.
